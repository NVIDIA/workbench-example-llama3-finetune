    "# Finetune and deploy the Llama3-8b model using SFT and VLLM \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to walk through the flow of using supervised finetuning (SFT) on the Llama3-8B model from scratch using the base model and then deploying it using VLLM. Ensure you have requested and have been approved access to this model via [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B). \n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-3 was has an 8k context length which is pretty small compared to some of the newer models that have been released and is was pretrained with 15 trillion tokens on a 24k GPU cluster. Luckily for finetuning, we only need a fraction of that compute power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will be using the base model in this notebook and not the instruct model. Additionally, we will be running through a full finetune with no quantization. This notebook was originally built for 2 A100-80GB GPUs, but the default hyperparameters have since been adjusted to run on 1x A100-80GB. If you're looking for a lighter Llama3-finetune, checkout out the other Llama3 finetuning notebook which uses Direct Preference Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Help us make this tutorial better! Please provide feedback on the [NVIDIA Developer Forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/ai-data-science/nvidia-ai-workbench/671).\n",
    "\n",
    "A note about running Jupyter Notebooks: Press Shift + Enter to run a cell. A * in the left-hand cell box means the cell is running. A number means it has completed. If your Notebook is acting weird, you can interrupt a too-long process by interrupting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Interrupt Kernel) or even restarting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Restart Kernel). Note restarting the kernel will require you to run everything from the beginning."
